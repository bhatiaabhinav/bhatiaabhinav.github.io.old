Hello! I'm a 5th year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), specializing in artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and robotics. I am advised by [Prof. Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/) and I also collaborate with [Prof. Scott Niekum](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/niekum-scott) and [Prof. Donghyun Kim](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/kim-donghyun). Before joining UMass, I was a research engineer at Singapore Management University, working with [Prof. Pradeep Varakantham](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/pradeepv/) and [Prof. Akshat Kumar](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/akshatkumar/index.html) on AI-driven solutions for large-scale constrained resource allocation. My previous experience includes software engineering at Walmart e-commerce and an internship at Amazon, working on Prime Video. I completed my B.E. (Hons.) in Computer Science from [BITS-Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India, in 2015.

My research goal is developing autonomous agents capable of operating safely, swiftly, and efficiently in unpredictable environments. Currently, my focus areas include meta reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning, meta-reasoning, real-time planning, and robotics.

Beyond AI, I'm passionate about physics, biology, neuroscience, and psychology, at times seeking insights for my research. I'm also keen on applying AI in science. I admire Richard Feynman, follow Roger Federer, enjoy Microsoft Flight Simulator, and, as my friends say, I can sing quite well!
