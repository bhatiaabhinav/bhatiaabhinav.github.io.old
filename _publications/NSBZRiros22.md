### Abstract
Abstractâ€” Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a natural, general-purpose way to model stochastic decision-making problems. However, the complexity of solving MDPs forces the use of approximate solvers for many practical applications. One popular approximation method is abstraction through state aggregation, which reduces the size of the problem but also introduces a new problem: how to decide when to use different abstractions in order to optimize the trade-off between MDP policy quality and computation time. This paper formally introduces the choice of state abstraction as a metareasoning problem using time-dependent utility. We then provide several general, cheaply estimated features that serve as effective heuristics for determining abstractions. Finally, we show that one can further optimize performance by using deep reinforcement learning with these features.
