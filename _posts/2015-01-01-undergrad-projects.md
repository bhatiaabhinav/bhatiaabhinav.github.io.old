These are some projects I did as an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani.

- **Monitoring factory workers' performance with Kinect (2014)**: Used deep learning to measure the quality of activity of factory workers. It performed well in varying lighting conditions, distances and orientations of workers w.r.t. the Kinect.
- **Tracking finger-gestures using Kinect to control a PC (2014)**: Won 1st prize in BITS-Pilani technical festival 2014 in appliances category.
- **Compiler-construction course project (2014)**: As part of a course project, developed a compiler to compile a toy language to x86 assembly code.
- **Many-to-one P2P media streaming (2013)**: Designed & developed UDP based many-to-one media streaming protocol.
- **Context aware home automation system (2013)**: Involved tracking humans using motion detection, blob detection, skin detection and stereo cameras.


### My Old Website

[Here](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/) is a website I maintained as an undergrad before 2015.

Link to each blog post on the website:
- [Chaser Bot Using Reinforcement Learning](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/chaser-bot-using-reinforcement-learning/) (2014). This was before I even knew anything like deep RL existed!

- [Simulated Evolution of Preys & Predators using GAs & ANNs](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/simulated-evolution-of-preys-predators-using-gas-nns/) (2014). At the time, I had just learned a lot about evolution from Richard Dawkin's books.

- [Compiler Construction Course Project](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/compiler-construction-project/) (2014).

- [PlAI Game](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/plai-game/) (2014). As a member of IEEE BITS-Pilani chaper, I conceptualized, coordinated and developed this video game for an AI bot making competition at BITS tech fest.

- [Scale-able P2P Media Sharing](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/2013/12/20/scale-able-p2p-media-sharing/) (2013)

- [Finger-tip Tracking Using Web Cam](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/finger-tip-tracking-using-web-cam/) (2013)

- [TCP/IP Video Call Software](https://abhinavcodes.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/tcpip-video-call-software/) (2012). Skype was blocked on our campus. So I thought why not make my own?
